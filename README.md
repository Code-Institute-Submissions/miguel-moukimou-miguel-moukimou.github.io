## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### Visitor Goals

        1. As Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are black, and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean font, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### Visitor Goals

    1. As Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a links to the details.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image
        3. The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, to learn more about the content.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   On some mobile devices the Hero Image pushes the size of screen out more than any of the other content on the page.
    -   A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result.
